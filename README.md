* PA5_1 project conclusions
*Considering the analysis above and the finding , I conclude the following:

* Drivers that are visiting the bars more than 1 time a month and are over the age of 25 have an acceptance rate close to 70%. There is a strong corelation between number ob monthly visits to the bars and the cupon acceptance rate
* If the drivers are also accompanied by other persons (excluding kids) then the acceptance rate can be slighly improved
* Age is not a relevant factor in cupon acceptance rate
* Income level also shows an inverse correlation with cupon acceptance rate. However, further anylizis are need to confirm the initial finding
